# CS 475/575 Parallel Programming - Spring 2024

This repository contains my completed projects for the CS 475/575 Parallel Programming course at Oregon State University, taught by Professor Mike Bailey in Spring 2024. The course focused on leveraging parallel programming techniques to improve program performance, covering topics like OpenMP, CUDA, OpenCL, and MPI.
